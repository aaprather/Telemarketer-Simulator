## Game Information
The goal of the game is to call and engage in dialogue with people in an attempt to sell as much of the Deerios brand candy that you can before the end of the day.

If the player fails to sell enough candy before the end of the day, they are fired from the company and must restart the game.

It is strongly suggested that the player do anything possible to make a sell whether immoral or not.
